# SVG Tutorial
<sup>Author: Jessica Sellers</sup>

<strong>Purpose:</strong> This tutorial will show people how to create a basic webpage in HTML5/CSS that contains SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

<strong>Target Audience:</strong> Anyone that has a very basic understanding of web development and coding



## Tutorial
<strong>Part 1: Getting Started</strong> 

First you will need to create a very basic webpage. For this you may want to download a code editor if you do not already have one. I suggest Brackets, you can download it [here.](http://brackets.io/)

Now open Brackets or whatever code editor you are using and create a new file named _SVG.html_

<strong>Part 2: Adding HTML Tags</strong> 

We will now populate the _SVG.html_ file that you created with the basic HTML tags. 

These are:
  * ``` <!DOCTYPE html> ```which defines the document type
  * ``` <html> ```which defines the root of an HTML document
  * ```<head>``` which defines information about the document
  * ```<title>``` which defines a title for the document
  * ```<meta>``` which describes metadata within an HTML document
  * ```<style>``` which defines style information for an HTML document
  * ```<body>``` which defines the documents body (where the content is)
  
Below I have demonstrated the basic layout of an HTML document:

``` 
<!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
  <head>
    <title>SVG Tutorial</title>  
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
   
   <style>
   
   /* Where the SVG will be styled */
    
   </style> 
   
  </head>

  <body>
   
   Where the SVG will go...
  
  </body>

</html>

```
